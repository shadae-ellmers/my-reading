        <p>Readr is a website and app built to make reading fun and easy.</p>
        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>
          Readr is built by a one-woman-team. I'm Shadae, and I work as a
          software developer full time and code on the side, which is how this
          project came to fruition. I love to read in my spare time, and wanted
          a way to make tracking my reading fun and easy for me.
